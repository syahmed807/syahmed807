CPU 
matrix 
Context SWITCH --- Multitasking -> kernel had to switch between multiple processes -> kernel scheduler ( /proc/pid)
RUN QUEUE -> Total number of active process --> top
CPU UTILIZATION - top , sar -P
LOAD AVERAGE - uptime -- will show last 1 5 15 mins   ->> 10 5 15 shows high number then issue
.........
Memory 
Physical - increases the speed 
Swap -- when memory is full or 80% --idel process from physcial memory
pages - memory is divided into chunks 
free -m or free -g
vmstat
sar -r 
32 bit only 4 gb
64 bit unlimited
..............................
disk IO
iostat
sar -b 
IO wait -- high io wait -- indicate problem in disk -- 1-4% above is high consistent above 10%
read/seconds - under 10 ms is good
tps - transactions per seconds 
..............
Network --tcp dump utility
Packet loss - 
tcpdump
