TCP dump useful inf
CP dump is a powerful network packet analyzer that captures and displays packet data on a network. The data captured can provide insights into network traffic, troubleshoot network issues, and analyze the communication between devices. Here are some useful pieces of information you can extract from a TCP dump:

Source and Destination IP addresses: Identify the devices communicating on the network.

Source and Destination Port numbers: Determine the application or service associated with the communication.

Packet Timing: Analyze the timing between packets to identify delays or performance issues.

Protocol Information: Identify the protocols used in the communication, such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.

Packet Size: Examine the size of packets to understand data transfer patterns and potential issues.

Flags: Check TCP flags (e.g., SYN, ACK, FIN) to understand the state of the TCP connection.

Payload Data: Inspect the actual data being transmitted for troubleshooting or security analysis.

TCP Window Size: Evaluate the TCP window size to understand flow control and potential network congestion.

Sequence and Acknowledgment Numbers: Track the sequence and acknowledgment numbers for TCP connections to identify out-of-order packets or retransmissions.

Fragmentation: Detect fragmented packets and analyze how devices handle packet reassembly.

ICMP Messages: Identify and analyze ICMP messages for network diagnostics and troubleshooting.

DNS Requests and Responses: Capture and analyze DNS traffic to understand domain resolutions and potential DNS issues.

HTTP Headers: Extract and inspect HTTP headers for web traffic analysis.

SSL/TLS Handshakes: Identify encrypted connections and analyze SSL/TLS handshake details for security purposes.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Requests and Responses: Monitor ARP traffic for device discovery and network mapping.

SYN Floods or other Network Attacks: Look for patterns that might indicate network attacks, such as SYN floods.

balance algorithm name 
Round Robin (default):distribute request sequentially in circular order
least connection : give request to server with few active connection
source ip hash -- send it to same clients for persistance
least time - send to quick response server 
weighted round robin -assign different weight to server amount of traffic each server handle
weighted least connection - server capacity + least connection
URO Hash - send request with same URI 
random - route traffic to avaliable server

DNS 
-->Browser type www.google.com it resolve domain --> iP Address
browser => DNS will search matching IP address => Communicate yahoo server

==> Phonebook --> look your number first by your name

Steps 
Browser type www.google.com => check cache memory -->If no
Resolver => (ISP internet service provider ==> check cache memory) => no
Root server (13 sets of root servers 12 differnt org owns)=>reroutes => TLD top level domain (org.com)
TLD ==> redirect ==> Authorative named server ( Know everything about domain )
CONNECTS TO YAHOO.COM -> save in cache memory 

DNS records 
A (Address) Record:IP ADDRESS 

The A record maps a domain name to the corresponding IPv4 address. It is commonly used to point a domain or subdomain to a specific web server.
AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record:

CNAME record creates an alias
MX (Mail Exchange) Record:
The MX record specifies the mail server responsible for receiving email messages for a domain. It includes the server's hostname and priority for handling incoming mail.

TXT (Text) Record:
The TXT record allows for the storage of arbitrary text data associated with a domain. It is commonly utilized for verification and authorization purposes, such as SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records for email authentication.

NS (Name Server) Record:
The NS record specifies the authoritative name servers for a domain, indicating which DNS servers are responsible for resolving that domain's DNS information.

SOA (Start of Authority) Record:
The SOA record contains authoritative information about a DNS zone, including details such as the primary name server for the zone and contact information for the domain administrator.

PTR (Pointer) Record:
The PTR record is used in reverse DNS lookups to map IP addresses to domain names, providing the reverse mapping of the A and AAAA records.
